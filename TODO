OSB-Server:
- getBugs: Handling of dateline
- getBugs: Only return a percentage of bugs depending on the zoom level

Mappa Mercia:
- Add sitemap
- Scrollbars in side bar are not displayed perfectly. Sometimes
  they obscur the sidebar toggle (Opera)
- Opera: map window resize seem to have some problems
- Add Closebox to popups
- Look at coordinate transformations for osb
- Look into the problem with the misplaced popups:
  Zooming in while showing a popup does not update the popup position.
  It also stops the pan bar from being updated.
- When getting position from the url update the position cookie
- Fix cursor bug in Opera
- Fix zoombar bug properly
- IE7 and Firefox 2 show button labels with odd alignment
- IE6 new bugs are not transparent
- IE6 form layouts are wrong (but still useable)
