	<h1>Dear Visitor,</h1>

	<p>you propably read this page because you wondered why the <a href="/">Mappa Mercia website</a> is so ugly and does not 
	work properly.
	</p>
	
	<p>This has nothing to do with the website but with the web browser that
	you are using. The Internet Explorer 6 has been released
	<strong>eight&nbsp;years</strong> ago and two new versions have been published
	since then. On the Internet eight years are a small eternity. Standards for
	designing webpages have improved a lot and it is now possible to create
	webpages that work across all modern browsers.
	</p>

	<p>However, since the standards have evolved so much your Internet Explorer
	6 does not understand them anymore. It is a bit like when you try to read a
	text written in Middle English. Just the other way round.
	</p>

	<p>I make this website in my spare time for fun. So, I mostly do things on
	it that I <em>like</em> to do. Spending a day to translate the site from
	the equivalent of Modern English to Middle English after the website is
	basically finished and working with all modern browsers is something I do
	not consider an enjoyable pastime. Therefore I do not do it.
	</p>
	
	<p>Over 90% of all Internet users today are using web browsers which
	understand the modern web standards. So, the majority of the users can
	enjoy the <a href="/">Mappa Mercia website</a> as it is intended. To
	everyone else I suggest to update their web browsers to enhance their
	experience of the Internet  and to make the live of all web designers
	easier!
	</p>

	<p>Here are some links to websites where you can download an up-to-date web browser:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome/?hl=en-GB">Google Chrome</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx">MS Internet Explorer 8</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thank you!
