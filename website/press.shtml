<p>Another first for Birmingham! &ldquo;OpenStreetMap is a free editable map of the
whole world. It is made by people like you.&rdquo; Today Birmingham takes a huge step
to becoming a digital City. The metropolitan area of Birmingham and its
environs within the motorway ring have now been completely digitally remapped
by its own citizens in a format which is freely editable and available at
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">www.openstreetmap.org</a>.
</p>

<p>It is the first English city to be completely remapped in this way. It joins
the likes of Paris, Berlin and Canberra. Birmingham now has a digital map that
is more up-to-date and accurate than all other online or satnav maps. Only
Ordnance Survey can claim to be more accurate &ndash; and they have huge technical
and financial resources at their disposal. (Click here for a detailed view of
Birmingham)
</p>

<p>The OpenStreetMap of Birmingham has been created by local people, with
local knowledge, who take pride in how their neighbourhood is represented and
can match, and even surpass, the efforts of commercial mappers who spend
millions creating this kind of rich data. A dedicated band of 100 volunteers
has been collecting GPS data whilst cycling, walking, and riding the buses and
trains. One of our team has even mapped by canal boat!
</p>

<p>The raw positional data is supplemented by additional visual observations
on the ground and then edited into a format that can be rendered as a map
readable by humans. All the software used in the project has been developed as
open source software and is free to download and use. All participants have to
do is invest their time and pay attention to detail.  &ldquo;It's very satisfying to
see a complete city mapped in OpenStreetMap. Four years ago when this project
was created we were looking at a blank screen and most commentators thought we
were crazy.&rdquo; said Andy Robinson, secretary of the OpenStreetMap Foundation and
a prolific mapper in the West Midlands.
</p>

<p>The Birmingham effort is part of a world wide movement to digitally remap
the entire world which started in 2004. The project was originated in the UK
and now involves some 85,000 enthusiasts globally, who have so far mapped
almost 14 million miles of road globally. We have mapped 15,000 residential
roads, 6,000 footpaths and 9,000 other roads in Birmingham (and over 700 bus
stops and 300 pubs and 200 traffic lights and 300 postboxes)
</p>

<h3>Why re-map the world?</h3>

<p>We need a free dataset for programmers, social activists, cartographers,
and communities and the like to use geodata and create maps suited to their
purposes without being limited by proprietary restrictions designed to protect
large corporate investments in data collection. Under-developed countries are
particularly helped by a project of this sort, because it is just not economic
for commercial mappers to map their areas.
</p>

<p>How can it be accurate? The essence of a wiki-style process is that all
users have a stake in having accurate data. If one person puts in inaccurate
data, maliciously or accidentally, the other 99.9% of people can check it, fix
it, or get rid of it. Just think how amazing it was a few years back when you
saw Google Maps for the first time. Suddenly mapping was cool, and access via
an API<a href="#footnote1" id="footnote1_ref">*</a> lead to a wave of
innovation. Satnav was nowhere 3 years ago. Look at it now! But you still can't
access the incredible amount of data locked behind the API and you can't add or
improve it, so your applications are limited. Just think of the explosion of
innovation, much of it in unexpected areas, that's possible when the data is
freed!  </p>

<p>All the software used in the project has been developed as opensource
software and is free to download and use. The data and maps are licensed by
Creative Commons which defines the spectrum of possibilities between full
copyright &ndash; all rights reserved &ndash; and the public domain &ndash; 
no rights reserved. What this means to users (and this isn't legal advice) is 
basically you can do what you like with the data, so long as you mention the 
original creator and the licence and anyone else can do the same with anything 
you produce.
</p>

<p>A flagship example of the power of opening up access to geodata is
OpenCycleMap. Itâ€™s a customised online map for cyclists, based on OpenStreetMap
data. It shows things that are interesting to cyclists including signed cycle
routes, offroad cycle paths, bike shops and bike parking &ndash; and of course hills
&ndash; whilst diminishing other things like motorways that are of little interest.
It's built on top of OpenStreetMap, and was recently commended by the British
Cartographic Society.
</p>

<h3>So we've got a map, what's next?</h3>

<ol>
	<li>There's most of the Black Country to map for a start!</li>

	<li>Local businesses and organisations can start using OSM maps and data,
	rather than proprietary sources, freeing themselves from the technical,
	financial and accuracy restrictions of commercial mapping providers.</li>
	
	<li><p>Now that we have a complete set of local data, Midlands software
	developers can start using it to create novel applications (e.g road
	traffic simulations, tourist trails, restaurant guides).
	</p>

	<p>Why would a business consider using OpenStreetMap data when anyone can
	use maps from Google, Mapquest or Yahoo for free? In a word: control. An
	OSM data and map user has significantly more control over their maps than
	someone who uses a free API. With OSM you can modify, supplement and select
	the data to create a customised map.
	</p></li> 
	
	<li>It might take a 100 people to produce a map like this but we need a
	1,000 to keep it up to date. Help us improve and verify the map via a
	simple tool available at <a href="http://openstreetbugs.appspot.com/">openstreetbugs.appspot.com</a>. 
	All you need is local knowledge and access to the internet.
